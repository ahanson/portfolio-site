I'm working on building a new personal portfolio site, using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/).

Right now, it's using the [default theme](https://github.com/jglovier/jekyll-new), but I'm going to change that soon.

##To do:
* Get content right.
* Fix up theme.
* Get a domain name and a host.
* Set up an email accont for the site.
* Set up a Google form to receive messages.
* Set up [Glynn](https://github.com/dmathieu/glynn) and [upload the site](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/deployment-methods/).
