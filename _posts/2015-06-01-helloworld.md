I'm working on building a new personal portfolio site, using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/).

Right now, it's using the [default theme](https://github.com/jglovier/jekyll-new), but I'm going to change that soon.

##To do:

###Done:
* Convert version control from [Mercurial to Git](http://www.lancejian.com/2012/02/05/convert-mercurial-repository-into-git.html).
* Made a [Git Repo](https://github.com/ahanson/portfolio-site) for my project.
* Set up [Glynn](https://github.com/dmathieu/glynn).


###Essential Stuff:
* Get content right.
    * Shrink picture on about page.
    * Fix up text on pages so that it isn't so choppy.
* Fix up theme.
    * use Poole theme instead?
    * create my own theme?
* Get a domain name and a host.
* Set up an email accont for the site.
* [Upload the site](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/deployment-methods/).


###Extra Features:
* Set up a [Google](https://www.google.com/forms/about/) or [WuFoo](http://www.wufoo.com/) form to receive messages?
* Enable comments with Disquis?
* Automatic validation and link checking?
