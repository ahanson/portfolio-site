I set up glynn so that it posts the site to a staging server at home.covad.net/~alexh67/.

I also set up _config.yml so that all the urls resolve correctly on that website.

##Problem: 

How do I set different values of baseurl and url depending on whether:

1. I'm testing the site on my local machine?
2. I'm staging it somewhere? 
3. I'm posting it to a production server?
