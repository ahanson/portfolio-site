  name: "Resources Plus"
  title: "Web Designer/QA"
  dates: "2000-2005"
  blurb: "Resources Plus was a marketing company and Internet Presence Provider in Hyde Park. It was a small company, and I had to wear a lot of hats. Sometimes I was a web designer. I built, maintained, and rebuilt many of the company's websites, using my knowledge of (X)HTML, CSS, Flash and JavaScript. When there were things I didn't understand, I had to collaborate with other designers. Other times, I had to put fires out. If our hosting company suddenly went out of business, I had to get customers back online fast. If some system admin messed up DNS settings so that a site didn't show up in half of the country, I had to grapple with them until they realised their mistake. If an overseas web designer did something that offended American clients, I had to clean up their mistakes quickly. When things were quieter, I was an administrator. I managed the domain names, web servers, email addresses and various passwords. I made sure that the important files were backed up. When the owner wasn't able to, I met up with clients and helped them work out design issues."
