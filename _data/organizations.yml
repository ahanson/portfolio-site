  title: "Intern"
  dates: "Fall 1997"
  blurb: "I was taking classes at American University in Washington D.C. for a semester, and got an internship for a NGO that advocated for people working in the diplomatic corps. I researched congressional votes on legislation relating to American engagement in international organizations, then compiled a report rating legislators on their commitment to an engaged foreign policy. (basically, I was in the library reading through back issues of the Congressional Review or doing searches on Thomas over a spotty 56k modem connection. Good times.)"
